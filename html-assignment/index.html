            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm going to quickly save you from confusion as my lastname pronounced with a <mark>silent h</mark>, it's known for confusing many people.<br>
                Anyways! I'm considered a friendly, generous, and funny indavidual and have many hobbies.</p>
                <p>First of which is music production. I've been making music for many years, 12 to be exact. My main genre's are house and drum & bass<br>
                ,I also love their sub-variations like tech-house, future-house, bass-house, tech dnb, liquid dnb the list goes on.<br> 
                I've used basically every mainstream digital audio workstation or DAW to see what fits my workflow (aka, spent too much money).<br>
                Currently I use FL Studio 20 and Reason 11 in conjunction, FL Studio is the main daw while I use Reason 11 as a plug-in for analog<br> 
                feeling sounds and fx. You can find my work on Soundcloud and Youtube, I simply go by the name <em>PELEHOS</em>.  
            </p>
            <p>Next is my love for technology. Building pc's, upgrading/ fixing mac's, pc gaming, media editing, again the list goes on.<br>
            The moment i found how much I loved tech was when I made the trasition from console to pc gaming, as when i swithced, I built<br>
            my very first desktop pc, It was so fun and exiting, It was kinda like a high and I still get that way when building pc's or upgrading mac's. <br>
            It was a decent system too, with a <em>AMD Ryzen 5 2600x<sup>6c/12th</sup></em>, <em>16gb of DDR4<sup>3200mhz</sup> memory</em>, and an <em>Nvidia RTX 2060</em>, gaming on high- ultra <br>
            settings comfortably gave me around <strong>80-140 frames</strong> at 1080p in game. Now my system has matured into a far more powerful machine, but all i can say<br> 
            is at least i got my gpu upgrade at retail price before the gpu shortage.
            </p>    
            <p>Other hobbies I have are
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>video editing</li>
                <li>graphic design</li>
                <li>drawing</li>
                <li>messing with linux</li>
                <li>collecting energy drink can's</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>I wont go too much detail about each one, but I am as equally passionate about them as i am with technology and music.</p>
